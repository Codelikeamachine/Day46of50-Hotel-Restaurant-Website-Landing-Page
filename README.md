Welcome to the Spice Haven project! This is a responsive restaurant website showcasing a beautiful dining experience with a diverse menu, cozy ambiance, and catering services. This project is part of my Day 46 of 50 web development projects challenge.

Spice Haven is a modern restaurant website designed to provide visitors with an engaging and visually appealing experience. The website includes sections for the home page, menu, about, and contact information, along with a dynamic slideshow and an interactive menu. This project is part of my journey to enhance my web development skills.
